----------
The following SQL join will get all IDCard-to-username mappings.
This may need to be further be limited by course for larger servers.
----------

SELECT data.data, user.username
  FROM 
    mdl_user as user, mdl_user_info_field as field, mdl_user_info_data as data
  WHERE 
    user.id = data.userID   AND
    data.fieldid = field.id AND
    field.shortname = 'idcard';
